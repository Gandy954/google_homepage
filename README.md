# google_homepage

2/23/21-Built sample Google homepage over the last several days. Its been difficult to recall all of the coding language that goes into each html/css element so a lot of googling general issues and a little bit of peeking at others code helped me get the page organized in a way that makes snese.
Thanks to 'CatQueenCodes' and 'Anarchomushroom' for posting their examples online.
Began process of adding a reset.css and stylesheet reference to beginning of html code instead of just dumping all css code into the head.

To do:
main logo (resize and center in page)
top nav (resize and adjust placement of links; add 'apps' icon and 'Sign in' input button
search bar (add manifying glass logo and resize)
bottom nav (seperate left and right links)
